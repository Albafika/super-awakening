## How?
`Super Game Boy` exposes up to 4 controller inputs to `Game Boy` games.  This feature enabled local multiplayer via `Super Game Boy` for games like `Street Fighter 2` or `Bomberman`.

The romhack takes advantage of this functionality by configuring a single IRL controller to use buttons for both `Super Game Boy` controllers inputs.  This double the number of inputs available for the game to use. Custom functionality is implemented for each of the additional inputs.

## Setup

* This romhack must be played using a `Super Game Boy`
* Controller 1 and Controller 2 inputs for the `Super Game Boy` should both map to a single IRL controller

### Controller Mapping
