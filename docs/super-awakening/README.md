## How?
The `Super Game Boy` exposes up to [4 controller inputs](https://gbdev.io/pandocs/Joypad_Input.html#usage-in-sgb-software) to the `Game Boy` system.  This feature enables local multiplayer for `Game Boy` games.

The romhack takes advantage of this functionality by configuring a single IRL controller to use buttons for both `Super Game Boy` controllers inputs.  This double the number of inputs available for the game to use. The romhack implements custom functionality for the additional button inputs.

## Setup

* This romhack must be played using a `Super Game Boy`
* `Super Game Boy` Controller 1 and Controller 2 should both map to a single `IRL controller`.

### Controller Mapping

`IRL Controller` is the physical controller used to play the romhack.  `SGB Controller` is the controller input for the `Super Game Boy` system.

| IRL Controller  | SGB Controller | SGB Button |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| `Up` | Player 1 |  `Up`  |
| `Down` | Player 1 |  `Down`  |
| `Left` | Player 1 |  `Left`  |
| `Right` | Player 1 |  `Right`  |
| `Start` | Player 1 |  `Start`  |
| `Select` | Player 1 |  `Select`  |
| `A` | Player 2 |  `Right`  |
| `B` | Player 2 |  `Down`  |
| `X` | Player 2 |  `Up`  |
| `Y` | Player 2 |  `Left`  |
| `R` | Player 2 |  `Start`  |
| `L` | Player 2 |  `Select`  |

### Unused `Super Game Boy` controller buttons
The `A` and `B` buttons on both `SGB Controller 1` and `SGB Controller 2` are not used in the romhack.  Pressing `A` or `B` on `SBG Controller 1` will have unexpected results in the games.
