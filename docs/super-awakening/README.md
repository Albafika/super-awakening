## Technical Background
The `Super Game Boy` system exposes up to [4 controller inputs](https://gbdev.io/pandocs/Joypad_Input.html#usage-in-sgb-software) for `Game Boy` games.  This feature enables local multiplayer for `Game Boy` games.

The `Super Game Boy` forwards button inputs from the `Super Nintendo` to button inputs on the `Game Boy`.  However, the `Game Boy` can only support 8 buttons per controller.  As a result, the additional `X`/`Y`/`R`/`L` buttons on the `Super Nintendo` controller are ignored.

The romhack takes advantage of this functionality by instructing the `Super Game Boy` to send the `X`/`Y`/`R`/`L` buttons from controller 1 to the `Up`/`Down`/`Left`/`Right` buttons for the `Game Boy` controller 2.  This allow a single controller from the `Super Nintendo` to send all 12 button inputs to the `Game Boy`.  The romhack implements custom functionality for the additional controller inputs.

## System Compatibility
This romhack is fully supported on an original `Super Nintendo` system using a `Super Game Boy`.  Not all emulators support the required `Super Game Boy` functions for this romhack.  `Game Boy Color` compatibility is experimental for supported systems.
