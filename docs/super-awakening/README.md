* Press R to change selected inventory slot to next item.
* Press L to change selected inventory slot to the previous item.

## How?
`Super Game Boy` exposes up to 4 controller inputs to `Game Boy` games.  This feature enabled local multiplayer via `Super Game Boy` for games like `Street Fighter 2` or `Bomberman`.

The romhack takes advantage of this functionality by configuring a single IRL controller to use buttons for both `Super Game Boy` controllers inputs.  This double the number of inputs available for the game to use. The romhack implementes custom functionality  the additional player2 inputs.

## Setup

* This romhack must be played using a `Super Game Boy`
* Controller 1 and Controller 2 inputs for the `Super Game Boy` should both map to a single IRL controller

### Controller Mapping

**IRL Controller** is the the real life controller used to play the game.  **SGB Controller** is the input in to the `Super Game Boy`.  Note that the `A` and `B` buttons on the GB Controller not mapped.
